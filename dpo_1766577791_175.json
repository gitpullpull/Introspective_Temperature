    "user_prompt": "My dishwasher is leaking like a sieve right now—water’s pouring onto the kitchen floor and spreading fast. I don’t have a shut-off valve key, and the main water supply is in the basement, which I can’t access because the door is jammed with a broken lock. I’ve got two towels and a roll of duct tape. My phone is about to die. I need to stop this leak NOW. Don’t give me general advice—give me a step-by-step physical action plan using what I have. Can I jam something in the hose? Wrap the pump? Tilt the unit? Tell me exactly what to do with my hands.",
    "thought_chosen": "This is an urgent fluid containment emergency with hard physical constraints: no access to water shutoff, no tools, and minimal materials. The user is in immediate danger of water damage and potential electrical hazard.\n\nPhase 1 - Immediate Risk Assessment <TEMP_LOW>:\nFirst, I must establish the non-negotiable facts: electricity and water are a lethal combination. I cannot suggest touching any electrical connections. Also, duct tape on a pressurized leak is useless—it fails under sustained pressure. These are physical laws, not opinions.\n\nPhase 2 - Flow Path Analysis <TEMP_LOW>:\nDishwasher leaks are not random. They follow gravity and pressure paths. The most common sources are the door seal, drain hose connection, or pump housing. The user needs to quickly diagnose the origin without tools. I must guide tactile identification.\n\nPhase 3 - Mechanical Intervention Strategy <TEMP_MID>:\nWith no valve key or basement access, the only viable solution is to physically interrupt the water supply *inside* the unit. The float switch is accessible and mechanical. If jammed in the 'full' position, it prevents the fill valve from opening on the next cycle. This won’t stop current flow if mid-cycle, but dishwashers only fill for ~2 minutes per cycle. Timing matters.\n\nPhase 4 - Containment Protocol <TEMP_HIGH>:\nWhile waiting for the cycle to end, creativity is needed for containment. The towels and duct tape can be used to construct a crude berm or channel to protect cabinets and flooring. But this is secondary to stopping inflow.\n\nPhase 5 - Final Block <TEMP_LOW>:\nOnce inflow stops, reinforce that the dishwasher must not be used again until repaired. No false optimism.\n\nToken plan: <TEMP_LOW> (physics/risks) → <TEMP_LOW> (source diagnosis) → <TEMP_MID> (float manipulation) → <TEMP_HIGH> (improvised containment) → <TEMP_LOW> (final warning).",
    "chosen_response": "You are in a time-critical fluid emergency. Every second counts, but so does precision. Follow this exactly.\n\n<TEMP_LOW>Immediate Physical Constraints:\n1. Do NOT unplug the dishwasher while standing in water. This risks electrocution. Wait until water stops flowing or you can stand on a dry surface.\n2. Duct tape will NOT seal a pressurized leak. The fill valve operates at 20-80 PSI. Tape will blow off instantly. Do not waste time on this.\n3. Tilting the unit will spread water faster and may damage internal components. Do not do it.\n\n<TEMP_LOW>Diagnose the Leak Source (30 seconds):\nKneel down and visually/tactually trace the water:\n- If leaking from bottom center: likely pump housing or drain hose connection.\n- If leaking from door: failed door gasket (common, but not immediately stoppable).\n- If water is spraying: high-pressure zone (inlet valve or pump)—do not touch.\n\nThis determines your action, but regardless of source, the inflow must be stopped.\n\n<TEMP_MID>Stop Water Inflow Using the Float Switch:\n1. Open the dishwasher door fully.\n2. Look in the bottom interior. Find the float—a 3-4 inch plastic cylinder that rises with water level (usually near the front).\n3. Press it UP with your hand and HOLD it there. This simulates a 'full tub' and prevents the control board from opening the fill valve on the next fill cycle.\n4. Most dishwashers fill only at the start of a cycle or for rinse phases. If it’s currently filling, wait 90 seconds (max fill time) while holding the float. If not, the next fill attempt will be blocked.\n\nThis does not drain existing water, but it prevents 90% of additional inflow. Do not let go until you’re sure no more water is coming in.\n\n<TEMP_HIGH>Improvised Containment with Available Materials:\nWhile holding the float, use your other hand to deploy the towels:\n1. Twist each towel tightly into a rope (2 ft long).\n2. Place them in a U-shape around the base of the dishwasher, forming a berm to block water from spreading under cabinets.\n3. Use small strips of duct tape to anchor the towel ends to the floor (don’t seal the top—capillary action will wick water into the towel).\n4. If the leak is from the drain hose (rear corner), wrap a dry section of towel around the joint and secure loosely with tape to absorb, not seal.\n\n<TEMP_LOW>Final Safety Lockout:\nOnce water stops flowing:\n1. Keep the float pressed up.\n2. Place a heavy object (cookbook, pan) on the door latch to prevent it from being closed accidentally.\n3. Write a note: 'DO NOT USE — FLOOD RISK' and tape it to the front.\n4. The dishwasher is now in a safe 'inflow-blocked' state. It must not be operated again until the leak source is repaired by a technician and water access is restored.\n\nThis buys you time until you can access the basement or get help. It does not fix the leak—it isolates the hazard.",
    "thought_rejected": "The user is panicking and needs immediate action. They mentioned duct tape and towels, so they want a hands-on fix. Let me focus on creative ways to seal the leak directly. \n\nThe key insight is that pressure can be overcome with enough tape or physical blocking. If the hose is leaking, wrapping it tightly might hold. If the door is leaking, shoving a towel in the seal could work. \n\nI should start with a creative <TEMP_HIGH> solution to empower the user, then get into specifics <TEMP_MID>, and end with a warning <TEMP_LOW>. The goal is to make them feel like they can fix it now with what’s on hand.",
    "rejected_response": "<TEMP_HIGH>Alright, you can beat this with what’s in your hands—towels and tape are your allies. Think like a field engineer: we’re improvising a pressure seal.\n\nHere’s the play: the leak is just water looking for a path. Block it with density and friction. Your towel isn’t just for mopping—it’s a modular gasket.\n\nTake one towel, roll it tightly into a 1-inch diameter rope. Find where the water is coming from—probably the door seam or a hose connection. Jam that towel rope directly into the leak point like a plug. Don’t be gentle; force it in. This compresses the fibers and creates a temporary dam.\n\nNow, wrap duct tape around the entire area—over the towel and onto the dishwasher body. Criss-cross it for reinforcement. The tape isn’t sealing the leak; it’s clamping the towel in place like a hose clamp. This is a classic field fix used in marine and auto work.\n\n<TEMP_MID>Step-by-Step Execution:\n1. Identify the wettest point—this is your main breach.\n2. Roll towel tightly; cut with scissors or tear if needed.\n3. Insert deeply into the seam or around the hose.\n4. Wrap duct tape in overlapping layers, pulling tight with each pass.\n5. Use the second towel to soak up residual flow while the seal sets.\n\nIf the leak is from the bottom, tilt the dishwasher slightly backward (lift the front feet) so water flows away from the motor and into the front, where you can catch it with the second towel.\n\n<TEMP_LOW>Last Check:\nOnce sealed, monitor for 10 minutes. If it holds, you’ve bought hours. But remember: this is a temporary fix. Do not run the dishwasher again until the part is replaced.",
    "rejection_category": "Premature_Creativity",
    "reasoning": "The Rejected response fails by leading with a <TEMP_HIGH> creative workaround (jamming towels and taping) without first acknowledging the hard physical constraints—duct tape cannot withstand dishwasher pressure, and jamming materials into a pressurized system may worsen the leak or create electrical hazards; the Chosen response correctly uses <TEMP_LOW> to establish these limits before proposing a safe, mechanical intervention (float switch blocking) that works within the system’s design."
